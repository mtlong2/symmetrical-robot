These repositories encompasses neural networks applied to various domains. Energy repository was a project to predict peak energy utilization for a building. This invovled merging weather data with energy utilization metrics into one file for the LSTM model to learn and be able to generalize on new data. This multivariate examples demonstrates LSTM model, one-to-one forecast, LSTM model many-to-one forecast, specifically forecast the next 3 and 6 hour energy utilzations time points. 

The Sentiment repository includes a project to generalize sentiment reviews of IMDB dataset using LSTM model.

The Tools repository includes scripts to help tune hyperparameters for different networks, explore the effects of different value scaling options on datasets, and examples of data munging.
